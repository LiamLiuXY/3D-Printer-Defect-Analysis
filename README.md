Project Description: 3D Printer Defect Classification

Overview:
Our project aims to enhance the quality control process in 3D printing by implementing a comprehensive defect classification system. Leveraging advanced technologies including a Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and machine learning algorithms, we have developed a solution that offers real-time defect analysis during the printing process. The system is designed to provide interactive feedback to users via a Telegram chatbot interface, ensuring seamless monitoring and control.

Key Components:

Raspberry Pi: Acting as the central hub of our system, the Raspberry Pi is responsible for orchestrating the entire process. It handles data acquisition from sensors, image processing, and communication with the user interface.

Sensors: We utilize a DHT11 sensor for monitoring temperature and humidity levels within the printing environment, ensuring optimal conditions for printing. Additionally, a PiCam is deployed to capture footage and video during the printing process, providing visual data for defect analysis.

Step Motor: Integrated into the system, the step motor enables precise control over the positioning of the PiCam, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the printing area.

Machine Learning Model: Employing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) classification model, we have trained it to recognize various defects in 3D prints. This model analyzes the footage captured by the PiCam in real-time, swiftly identifying any anomalies or imperfections.

Telegram Chatbot Interface: To facilitate user interaction and feedback, we have developed an intuitive Telegram chatbot interface. Users can receive real-time updates on the printing process, including defect analysis results and recommendations.

Functionality:

Real-time Monitoring: The system continuously monitors the printing process, providing users with up-to-date information on temperature, humidity, and defect analysis.

Defect Classification: Leveraging the power of machine learning, our system accurately identifies and classifies defects such as warping, layer misalignment, or extrusion issues in real-time.

Interactive Feedback: Through the Telegram chatbot interface, users can receive instant notifications regarding the printing status and any detected defects. They can also access historical data and recommendations for improving print quality.

Benefits:

Enhanced Quality Control: By detecting defects in real-time, our system enables proactive intervention, minimizing print failures and material wastage.

User-Friendly Interface: The Telegram chatbot interface offers a seamless user experience, allowing users to monitor and control the printing process remotely with ease.

Cost-Efficiency: With improved quality control and reduced material wastage, our solution helps businesses save costs associated with failed prints and rework.

In summary, our 3D Printer Defect Classification project combines cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize quality control in 3D printing. By providing real-time defect analysis and interactive feedback, we empower users to achieve higher efficiency and precision in their printing endeavors.
